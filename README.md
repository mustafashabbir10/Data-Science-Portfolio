# Data-Science-Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R files.

*Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.

- ### Machine Learning
    - [Automatic Detection and Classification of Cardiac Arrhythmia](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/Cardiac-Arrhythmia) : A classification model to accurately detect and classify the presence of cardiac arrhythmia in patients by analuzing various features of Electrocaridogram (ECG) of the patients.
    - [Movie Segmentation of Top 250 movies from IMDB](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/MovieClustering) : A model to find inherent clusters in IMDB's Top 250 movies and investigate some distinct features responsible for higher ratings. Unsupervised machine learning techniques will be employed, more specifically, clustering algorithms to find clusters that will give information to observe the recurrent pattern.
