# Data-Science-Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R files.

*Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.

# Contents

- ### Machine Learning
    - [Automatic Detection and Classification of Cardiac Arrhythmia](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/Cardiac-Arrhythmia) : A classification model to accurately detect and classify the presence of cardiac arrhythmia in patients by analuzing various features of Electrocaridogram (ECG) of the patients.
    - [Movie Segmentation of Top 250 movies from IMDB](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/MovieClustering) : A model to find inherent clusters in IMDB's Top 250 movies and investigate some distinct features responsible for higher ratings. Unsupervised machine learning techniques will be employed, more specifically, clustering algorithms to find clusters that will give information to observe the recurrent pattern.
    - [Prediction of Customer Pickup Density for Chicago Cabs](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/Chicago-Cab-Data) : A predictive model which aims to forecast the total trip amount and number of rides from a particular location at a given hour of the day so that Taxi Companies can can allocate their resources effectively by diverting the cabs to a specific location during specific times.

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
    - [NYC Limousine & Taxi](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/New-York-Taxi-Data/blob/master/EDA.ipynb) : In this notebook, I will explore data on New York City Yellow Taxi of September 2015. I have first tried to answer some warm-up questions on the dataset which will be followed by interactive plots using ipython widget. This code is fully written in python and is an initial Exploratory Data Analysis prior to Data Modelling and predictions. The core objective of this repo is to analyse factors for demand for taxis, to find most pickups, most dropoffs, time of most traffic and how to overcome the needs of the public.

- ### Micro Projects: 
    - [Linear Regression using Gradient Descent](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/Linear-Regression) : This example project demonstrates how Gradient Descent Algorithm may be used to solve Linear Regression problem as Opposed to solving it by Scikitlearn.
    - [Logistic Regression using Gradient Descent](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/Logistic-Regression) : This example project demonstrates how Gradient Descent Algorithm may be used to solve Logistic Regression problem as Opposed to solving it by Scikitlearn. Secondly, this project also shows how regularized gradient descent can be used to model non-linear data.
    - [Developing Algorithmic Trading Strategies using Python](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/Algorithmic-Trading) : In this project I have done some common financial analysis such as moving windows, volatility calculation followed by developing a simple momentum strategy, backtesting it and evaluating strategy's robustness and performance.
    
    -[NYC-Taxi Fare Amount Prediction](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/New-York-Taxi-Data): In this project, I explored multiple linear regression and KNN regression to accurately predict the fare amount in NYC taxi dataset.
