# Data-Science-Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R files.

*Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.

# Contents

- ### Machine Learning
    - [Automatic Detection and Classification of Cardiac Arrhythmia](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/Cardiac-Arrhythmia) : A classification model to accurately detect and classify the presence of cardiac arrhythmia in patients by analyzing various features of Electrocardiogram (ECG) of the patients.
    - [Movie Segmentation of Top 250 movies from IMDB](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mustafashabbir10/MovieClustering/blob/master/Data_Clustering_upload.ipynb) : A model to find inherent clusters in IMDB's Top 250 movies and investigate some distinct features responsible for higher ratings. Unsupervised machine learning techniques will be employed, more specifically, clustering algorithms to find clusters that will give information to observe the recurrent pattern.
    - [Prediction of Customer Pickup Density for Chicago Cabs](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/Chicago-Cab-Data) : A predictive model which aims to forecast the total trip amount and number of rides from a particular location at a given hour of the day so that Taxi Companies can can allocate their resources effectively by diverting the cabs to a specific location during specific times.
     - [Restaurant Recommendation Engine](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mustafashabbir10/Yelp-Recommender-System/blob/master/Recommender_System.ipynb) : In this work, I have created a recommendation system for restaurants using collaborative filtering (CF). The general structure of a recommendation system is that there are users and there are items. Users express explicit or implicit preferences towards certain items. CF thus relies on users' past behavior.
    

- ### Time Series Analysis
    - [Prognostics : Forecasting of Remaining Useful Life of an Arifcraft Engine](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/Prognosis) : In this project I used time series analysis on multivariate sensor data to develop a prognostics based machine health performance assessment algorithm. Sensor data was used to extract the health index of the machine which was then modeled using Polynomial Curve Fitting, ARIMA models and Single Layer Perceptron to forecast the reamining useful life of the machine. This system helped in reducing downtime operations cost and aided in decision making for predictive maintenance.
    - [Developing Algorithmic Trading Strategies using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mustafashabbir10/Algorithmic-Trading/blob/master/Algorithmic_Trading.ipynb) : In this project I have done some common financial analysis such as moving windows, volatility calculation followed by developing a simple momentum strategy, backtesting it and evaluating strategy's robustness and performance.

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
    - [NYC Limousine & Taxi](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mustafashabbir10/New-York-Taxi-Data/blob/master/EDA.ipynb) : In this notebook, I will explore data on New York City Yellow Taxi of September 2015. I have first tried to answer some warm-up questions on the dataset which will be followed by interactive plots using ipython widget. This code is fully written in python and is an initial Exploratory Data Analysis prior to Data Modelling and predictions. The core objective of this repo is to analyse factors for demand for taxis, to find most pickups, most dropoffs, time of most traffic and how to overcome the needs of the public.
    - [Chicago Cab Data](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/Chicago-Cab-Data/blob/master/EDA.pdf) : This is a basic EDA on Chicago cab data done on Tableau to see how the prediction variable (customer pickup density) behave with various features and how these features can be cleaned and leveraged in the model to achieve best results. 

- ### Micro Projects: 
    - [Linear Regression using Gradient Descent](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/Linear-Regression) : This example project demonstrates how Gradient Descent Algorithm may be used to solve Linear Regression problem as Opposed to solving it by Scikitlearn.
    - [Logistic Regression using Gradient Descent](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/Logistic-Regression) : This example project demonstrates how Gradient Descent Algorithm may be used to solve Logistic Regression problem as Opposed to solving it by Scikitlearn. Secondly, this project also shows how regularized gradient descent can be used to model non-linear data.
    - [NYC-Taxi Fare Amount Prediction](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/New-York-Taxi-Data): In this project, I explored multiple linear regression and KNN regression to accurately predict the fare amount in NYC taxi dataset.
    - [Image Classification with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/CatorNoCat/blob/master/Logistic_Regression.ipynb): In this project, I have built an image recognition algorithm that correctly classifies pictures as cat or no cat using Logistic Regression and Gradient Descent.
