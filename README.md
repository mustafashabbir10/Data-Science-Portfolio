- ### Machine Learning
    - [Automatic Detection and Classification of Cardiac Arrhythmia](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/Cardiac-Arrhythmia) : A classification model to accurately detect and classify the presence of cardiac arrhythmia in patients by analuzing various features of Electrocaridogram (ECG) of the patients.
    - [Movie Segmentation of Top 250 movies from IMDB](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/MovieClustering) : A model to find inherent clusters in IMDB's Top 250 movies and investigate some distinct features responsible for higher ratings. Unsupervised machine learning techniques will be employed, more specifically, clustering algorithms to find clusters that will give information to observe the recurrent pattern.
    - [Prediction of Customer Pickup Density for Chicago Cabs](https://github.com/mustafashabbir10/Chicago-Cab-Data) : A predictive model which aims to forecast the total trip amount and number of rides from a particular location at a given hour of the day so that Taxi Companies can can allocate their resources effectively by diverting the cabs to a specific location during specific times.
